Final project of Programming languages of my erasmus semester(Feb-Jun 2022) at the university of Ruse bulgaria 
This was coded by me and Celian, who i teamed up with for that project.

The assignment was to create a class with 3 subclasses. All classes must have at least 3 attributes. 
Those attributes must be filled from a Graphical interface and the new obects stored in an array.
All object can be listed and a search can be made choosing a field.
